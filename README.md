School Management System, is an open source project for people who wants to grab the core idea of the data process within the system. As well as, you can practice this system for the assignments too. Though, if you want to use it on the online project then I highly recommend implementing the php security. Since we just wanted to provide this system as a platform for beginners or intermediate programmer to study and learn how the data process from the frontend to the backend in the system.

This system is built with CodeIgniter â€“ PHP framework, bootstrap, and jquery. This system, School Management System, is based on the Web Application. It provides advanced functionality run the daily basic requirement for the school program. The system can be manipulated by one user as an admin.

This application, there are some dependencies you will need to understand. For example, you want to add the section for a class. Without class information, the section information cannot be added to the system. Similarly, these concepts apply to the subject, student, and etc. Without any class and section, the subject, and student information cannot be created by the system.

Please read the below instruction to run the application on your system without any difficulties. There are few changes required in the source code to run the application. So Please follow the steps carefully.
